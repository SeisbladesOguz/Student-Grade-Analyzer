- **Dynamic Input:** Users can specify the number of grades to be analyzed.
- **Data Analysis:** Calculates the average, maximum, and minimum grades.
- **Status Reporting:** Automatically determines the pass/fail status based on a configurable threshold (50.0).
- **Format Precision:** Displays results with two decimal places for professional output.

- A professional Java console application designed to collect, process, and analyze student grades. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as array manipulation, loops, and conditional logic.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS ## 
I plan to enhance this project with the following features:
*Advanced Formatting:** Implement better text alignment and table-like structures in the console for a cleaner UI.
